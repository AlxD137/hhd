  <p>The Hawkeye Hash Dynasty started circa 2010, as a fun 10-man league, drawing inspiration from the FX TV show The League.</p>
  <p>Since then, our league has changed in many ways. League members have come and gone, but in the past few years we've tightened the circle to 14 members who are fanatic about fantasy football.</p>
